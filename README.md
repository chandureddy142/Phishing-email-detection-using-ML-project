# 🛡️ PhishGuard 5.0 | Neural Security Terminal

**PhishGuard 5.0** is a high-fidelity, multi-layered cybersecurity forensic tool designed to detect, analyze, and report phishing attempts. It combines **Machine Learning (AI)**, **Heuristic Analysis**, and **Real-time Threat Intelligence** into a reactive, glassmorphism-style "War Room" dashboard.



## 🌟 Core Features

- **Neural Linguistic Engine**: Leverages TF-IDF vectorization and a Naive Bayes/Random Forest model to analyze the "intent" and emotional triggers of a message.
- **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Unlike "black-box" systems, PhishGuard identifies and lists specific forensic markers (e.g., *Urgent, Verify, Password*) used to reach its verdict.
- **4-Layer Defense Grid**:
    1. **Neural Layer**: Intent & Probability analysis.
    2. **Heuristic Layer**: Keyword & Pattern matching.
    3. **Reputation Layer**: Live Google Safe Browsing API integration.
    4. **Identity Layer**: Domain whitelisting and Spoof detection.
- **Interactive HUD**: A responsive Glassmorphism UI with live-moving "Satellite Tracking" background nodes and a scanning laser effect.
- **Forensic PDF Export**: One-click generation of professional audit reports for security compliance.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.9+ / Flask
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-Learn / Joblib
- **Database**: SQLite / SQLAlchemy
- **Frontend**: Tailwind CSS / Lucide Icons / Vanilla JS (ES6)
- **APIs**: Google Safe Browsing V4
